<h1>Day 8 of GWC:</h1>
<p>Python and Scratch have few similarites and differences. they both use variables
in order to help the code process. additionally, its based off of a trial and error
process. some differences include that there are no characters in python. also, scratch
already has the dictionary where you can drag and pull stuff together. Whereas, python
 you completely make up the code on your own by type or copy and pasting.
on another note, debugging the program in python was very frustrating. i spent an hour
finding out how to change the color and finally, i had found out how to do it. i felt a
weight off my shoulder because it took me so long.
<h1>DAY 10 OF GWC:</h1>
 a list is basically a list of lists. it kind of describes a certain thing like a varibale
 does but it is not a variable. It's useful because it organizes your data. its very easy
 and convienant to use.I think me and Sanjana worked well together. we bounced idewas off
 of each other. Hope and Anwen understood the subject well enought o explain a few topics to
 me that we got wrong.
 <h1>OBAMACON:</h1>
 This is the first project that wasnt as hard because it didnt involve all these extra steps.
 it was a very simple task. making lists wasnt as challanging and i actually enjoyed making them.
 a difficultly couldve been where i wanted to edit the colors instead of using the original ones
 that they provided for us. i wasnt sure how to plug them in at first, but then my
 partner showed me how to do it. she wasnt completely correct, but when we presented my teacher
 told me i corrected it and made it more clear. i used each element of Core4 into my project. if
 i had more time i would make the filter seem natural but also unique and fiferent at the same time.
 my highlight was the lists. i feel like it was the first thing out of the whole two weeks that i had
 acomplished 100% right all on my own. i did not like logisim. im finally starting to understand
 python more and more as we move foward.
 <h1>ROBOTICS:</h1>
 they both work extremly hard and take multiple trials of code to find the perfect solution. our team
 was very productive abd innovative. we worked very well together. another group nitelligently and creatively
 incorporated a song into their lighshow. basic pieces was a for loop and the same type of
 coding outline.</p>
