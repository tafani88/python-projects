<h1>Tafani</h1>
<p>Hi guys! My name is Tafani Mustafa. I'm a 16 year old girl who lives in New York.
I spent my summer at thr Girls Who Code program along with the other members of this team.
Preparing for the furture is one of the topics thats always floating around in my mind,
so i make sure to participate in a variety of after school activities, explaining part of
the reason why i am in this program right now. Currently, i'm junior at tottenville high
school in the honors program. Building this website was definately more time-consuming than
 we all thought it would be. The whole meaning behind the purpose of this website is to aid
 all ages and all people who suffer through busy schedules and stress related situations.
 As a cofounder I too understand because sometimes i don't manage my time well and resulting
 in unwanted stress.<p>
 <h1>Meghan:</h1>
 <p>This is the first project that wasnt as hard because it didnt involve all these extra steps.
 it was a very simple task. making lists wasnt as challanging and i actually enjoyed making them.
 a difficultly couldve been where i wanted to edit the colors instead of using the original ones
 that they provided for us. i wasnt sure how to plug them in at first, but then my
 partner showed me how to do it. she wasnt completely correct, but when we presented my teacher
 told me i corrected it and made it more clear. i used each element of Core4 into my project. if
 i had more time i would make the filter seem natural but also unique and fiferent at the same time.
 my highlight was the lists. i feel like it was the first thing out of the whole two weeks that i had
 acomplished 100% right all on my own. i did not like logisim. im finally starting to understand
 python more and more as we move foward.<p>
 <h1>Brittany:</h1>
 <p>they both work extremly hard and take multiple trials of code to find the perfect solution. our team
 was very productive abd innovative. we worked very well together. another group nitelligently and creatively
 incorporated a song into their lighshow. basic pieces was a for loop and the same type of
 coding outline.</p>
