<h1 id="desc">Group Description:</h1>
<p>Hi guys! Our names are Tafani, Meghan, Orli, Brittany, and Sylvia. We are a
group of four girls who participated in a Girls Who Code program at Moody's over
the summer.  Towards the end of the program we had to make  a final project about
any idea/topic that we chose. Luckily, we all had the same idea in mind; time
management! Us four girls feel like this is a big issue that many people go through,
but just don't act upon it. a website like this would raise the topic and address it
more and help those who could really use it. So we all thought that A few weeks later,
this website was created and is continuously being updated.
</p>

<h1>Misson:</h1>
<p>The whole meaning behind this website is to aid all ages and all people who
suffer through busy schedules and stress related situations. We too understand
because sometimes we don't manage our time well and resulting in unwanted stress.
The goal was to help the user stay organized and put together so they can focus
better on their work and other activites. We really hope this changes and/or
effect someones life postively.</p>
